## Extensions

Extensions are a way to add new functionality to the core of the application. They can be used to add new features, modify existing ones, or even remove them. Extensions are a powerful way to customize the application to your needs. The extension module of Space ROS has a collection of extensions that can be used to add new features to the application. The extensions that are available in the extension module are:

 - [Rover Simple Controller](./rover-simle-controller.md) - This extension adds a simple controller for the rover in the simulation environment to allow controlling mobile platforms using teleoperation.
 - [Omnigraph Example](./negate-number.md) - This extension provides an example of how to use the omnigraph node feature in the application to create custom graphs for the simulation environment.
